		<h2>Sunny Valley</h2>

		<p class="width">
		    The 9-hole "Sunny Valley" consists of 3,642 yards as well as four different playable tee boxes. Played as a more traditional course, this is a great start for beginner golfers. Sunny Valley also holds the longest par 5, of Baron Golf, which runs along side of the Colorado River.

	<div class="second">

		<h2>Rye</h2>

		<p>
		    The 9-hole "Rye" course consists of 3,329 yards, as well as four different playable tee boxes. Just before the slope of Clinmark Mountain, Rye is a more flat linx style course. The thick brush consistent throughout each hole, makes staying on the fairway a necessity. You will find most sand traps on the Rye, numbered at 46.

		<h2>Rolling Hills</h2>

		<p>
		    The 9-hole course "Rolling Hills" consists of 3561 yards, as well as four different playable tee boxes. The closest to Baron Country Clubs pro shop, Rolling Hills plays just as it sounds. The most dense of the three courses, Rolling Hills is known as the most difficult to play.
